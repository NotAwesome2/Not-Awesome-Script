# Not-Awesome-Script
Scripting plugin made for Not Awesome 2.


The included .dll files must be placed next to MCGalaxy.exe before the plugin can be loaded.
Script files (.nas) should be placed in "scripts" folder, and "os" scripts (which can be automatically uploaded by players with /osus) are placed in "scripts/os" folder.

Items are stored as one file per item in "extra/inventory/playername+" folder, and other script data is stored in "extra/inventory/playername+/data/data.txt".

You can add descriptions to items (/stuff look) by adding a .txt file that matches the item name in "text/itemDesc" folder. For instance, the contents of PRETTY_GEM.txt will be displayed when the player does /stuff look pretty gem.
